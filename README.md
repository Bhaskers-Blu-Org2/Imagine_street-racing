## Welcome to Microsoft Imagine's Street Racing
Hello from the [Microsoft Imagine team](http://imagine.microsoft.com)! Thanks for checking out our game, **Street Racing**. Create an endless road, obstacles, and a cool crash effect in this Unity game!

## Microsoft Imagine?
Microsoft Imagine gives you the tools you need to experiment, explore, and launch your ideas.  Learn the basics of coding and you can create anything you dream. See where you can take code, and where coding can take you.  

## What is this?

This repository holds the assets and C# source code for the game, **Street Racing**. 

If you're new to Unity, C#, or just need some guidance overall, [head to the Street Racing page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/imagine/imagine-create041) on the [Microsoft Imagine site](http://imagine.microsoft.com) and follow our steps in the embedded Office Mix to complete the code for your own version of the game.

Otherwise, feel free to use our Street Racing code and assets to start building the kinds of games you like to play in Unity and C#, and develop the skills to turn your own ideas into something real.  

## How do I start?
To get started with Street Racing, you'll want to install the following:
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Unity (5.2 or higher)](http://unity3d.com/get-unity)
* [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) (Note that you can choose to install VS Community 2015 during your Unity installation.)

The [Street Racing page's Office Mix](https://msdn.microsoft.com/imagine/imagine-create041) has installation instructions if you need them.

## How do I use GitHub Desktop to get this?
Never done this before and just want the files to work with on your own? 

Click on the small **Clone in Desktop** button and you'll make a copy of all of these files on your machine that you can work with.  Alternatively, **Download ZIP** and then unzip the files in a familiar location on your computer.

Remember where you save these Street Racing files, since Unity needs to know where to work!
